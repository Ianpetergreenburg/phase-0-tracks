One user can enter a word (or phrase, if you would like your game to support that), and another user attempts to guess the word.

Guesses are limited, and the number of guesses available is related to the length of the word.

Repeated guesses do not count against the user.

The guessing player receives continual feedback on the current state of the word. 
So if the secret word is "unicorn", the user will start out seeing something like "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", 
which would become "_ _ _ c _ _ _" after the user enters a guess of "c".

The user should get a congratulatory message if they win, and a taunting message if they lose.

#begins with asking the first user a word to play with
#that word is then accepted and a blank form of the word is created
#generate an appropriate amount of guesses dependent on the amount of letters in the word
#accept a guess letter
#make sure it hasn't been guessed before
#if it hasn't check if it is in the word
#if it is then reveal the letter in the blank form
#--add the letter to a cache of guessed letters
#--increase the guess count
#if game is won give a congratulatory message
#if guess count hits 0 then give losing message
