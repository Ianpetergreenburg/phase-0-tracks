# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the tracking of changes for a code/file/folder through a logging of the data's statuses. It's useful to be able to see when and where changes were made in the data in order to resolve possible bugs that occurred as a result of those changes. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a temporary copy of your data that allows you to work in an environment that doesn't affect the original data. Branches are used to allow multiple users to work on a code and if the changes were deemed helpful or wanted can be merged back into the original data.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a version save of your data that can be returned to at a later time to review changes. A good commit message is clear and concise about what changes have been made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when a change that occurred on the branch interferes with the functioning of the data when introduced back into the master data. A merge conflict can halt the merge process and depending on your system can help walk the user through the conflicts and determine best how to resolve them.
