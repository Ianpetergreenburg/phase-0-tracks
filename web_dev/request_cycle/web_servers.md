In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
You don't want the programs you're running to run within root so that administrative access is reserved for when it's necessary. Basically just a good security measure.
